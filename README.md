This repository focuses on the deployment of applications using ArgoCD and the GitOps methodology. GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and application deployments, where the desired state of the system is stored in a Git repository.

In this repository, you will find resources, configuration files, and examples that demonstrate the implementation of GitOps with ArgoCD. The repository highlights the following key aspects:

1. ArgoCD Setup:
   - Detailed instructions and configuration files for setting up ArgoCD.
   - Guidelines for configuring authentication, authorization, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) settings within ArgoCD.

2. GitOps Workflow:
   - Insights into the GitOps workflow and how it enables declarative infrastructure and application deployments.
   - Explanation of how changes in the Git repository trigger automatic deployments through ArgoCD.
 
3. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Strategies for monitoring and observing applications deployed using ArgoCD.
